I replaced all (most; not sure yet) BLAS calls with hand coded Julia. The results are encouraging, but also confusing the issues further, at least in some respect.

1. The whole thing runs faster, even for serial execution. 7.3 vs. 19 seconds for the serial case.
2. The speed up is now reasonable:  efficiency is 0.82 for 2 threads, 0.62 for 4 threads, and 0.51 for 8 threads. Previously the speed up was an unmitigated disaster (efficiency of 0.57, 0.3, 0.17).
3. So clearly there must be some interaction between the BLAS threads and the Julia threads.
4. It was not possible to turn off this interaction by setting the number of blas threads to 1.

The last item is clearly a cause for concern. People won't be able to efficiently utilize Julia threads unless the interaction with lower-level libraries can be resolved.
