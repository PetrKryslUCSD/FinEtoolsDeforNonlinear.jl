Issues and ideas:


-- Documenter:
using FinEtoolsDeforNonlinear
using DocumenterTools
Travis.genkeys(user="PetrKryslUCSD", repo="https://github.com/PetrKryslUCSD/FinEtoolsDeforNonlinear.jl")

-- Make all "traction_bcs" referred to force intensity objects.

– cauchyt = Fn1*(S/det(Fn1))*Fn1'; # Cauchy stress
This should be really coded as a special transformation. Available both for
Matrix (tensor) storage and for a vector storage.

– How to make integration-point material update thread safe?
function MatDeforNeohookean(mr::Type{DeforModelRed3D}, mass_density::FFlt, E::FFlt, nu::FFlt)
	_mI = diagm(0=>[1, 1, 1, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]);
	_m1 = vec(FFlt[1 1 1 0 0 0]) ;
	_m1m1 = _m1*_m1';
	_I3 = [1.0 0 0; 0 1.0 0; 0 0 1.0]
If we create a deep copy of the material, these buffers should be thread safe. Needs to be checked, though.
